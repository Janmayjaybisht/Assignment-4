        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to design software using \"objects.\" These objects group related data and actions together, making code easier to understand, reuse, and manage.It focuses on concepts like classes,inheritance,and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "    - A class in OOP is like a blueprint for creating objects.It defines the structure and behavior of the object by specifying its properties (data) and methods (actions).Objects are built using this class template.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "    - An object in OOP is a specific thing created from a class (blueprint).It has properties (data) and methods (actions) defined by the class. For example, a car object might have color (property) and drive (method).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "    - Abstraction hides complex details, showing only important features to users (like using a TV without knowing how it works).Encapsulation bundles data and methods together,restricting direct access to protect and organize it better.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") in Python are special methods surrounded by __ (e.g., __init__). They let you define object behaviors,like how it initializes, adds, or represents itself.They're also called magic methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "    - Inheritance in OOP allows a class (child) to reuse and extend the features of another class (parent).The child class gets the parent's properties and methods,making code reusable and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism in OOP means \"one thing, many forms.\" It lets objects from different classes use the same method name but behave differently.For example, a draw() method could work for both a circle and a rectangle.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "    - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods in a class. You can control access using access modifiers: public (name), protected (_name), and private (__name).This helps protect and organize the data effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "    - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__.It runs automatically when creating an object from a class. It helps initialize the object by setting its properties (data) with values provided during creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python,class methods use @classmethod and work with the class itself, not objects, accessing or changing class-level data.Static methods use @staticmethod and don’t depend on class or object data; they’re like independent functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method overloading in Python allows defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.However, Python doesn't support true overloading. Instead, you can use default arguments or variable-length arguments to simulate overloading behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding in OOP happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class.This allows the child class to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - A property decorator in Python, written as @property,allows you to define a method that acts like an attribute.It lets you access the method as if it were a variable,providing control over getting, setting, or deleting values.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different objects to use the same method name but behave differently.This promotes code reusability,flexibility,and easier maintenance,as you can work with various object types using a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.It serves as a blueprint for other classes.It may contain abstract methods, which must be implemented by any subclass that inherits from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - OOP offers several advantages: it makes code reusable,easier to maintain,and more organized. It encourages modular design,where objects can be updated independently.OOP also improves scalability and allows for clear modeling of real-world problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "    - A class variable is shared by all instances of a class,meaning its value is the same for every object.An instance variable is specific to each object,so each instance can have its own unique value.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class.This helps a child class combine features from multiple parents,but it requires careful handling to avoid conflicts between inherited methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "    - The `__str__` method in Python defines a readable, user-friendly string for an object, often for printing.The `__repr__` method provides a detailed, developer-focused string for debugging.Both help represent objects as text in different\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - The `super()` function in Python lets a child class access methods or properties of its parent class. It's commonly used to call the parent class's `__init__` method,ensuring inherited behaviors are initialized properly without rewriting code.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The `__del__` method in Python is a special method called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.It lets you clean up resources (like closing files) before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, `@staticmethod` defines a method that doesn’t use class or object data. `@classmethod` uses `cls` to work with class-level data.Use `@staticmethod` for independent tasks and `@classmethod` for tasks related to the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - In Python,polymorphism with inheritance lets child classes have methods with the same name as in the parent class. Each child class can customize the method's behavior,allowing the same method name to work differently for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining in Python OOP means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. Each method returns the object itself (`self`),allowing you to \"chain\" calls for cleaner,more concise code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "    - The `__call__` method in Python lets an object be used like a function. If defined in a class, you can call objects of that class directly,executing the logic inside the `__call__` method."
